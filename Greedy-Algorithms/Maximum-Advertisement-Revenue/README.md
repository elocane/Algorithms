# Maximum Advertisement Revenue

This algorithm implements a solution to the following problem: Given two sequences a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i is the profit per click of the i-th ad) and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (b_i is
the average number of clicks per day of the i-th slot), we need to partition them into n pairs (a_i, b_j)
such that the sum of their products is maximized.
