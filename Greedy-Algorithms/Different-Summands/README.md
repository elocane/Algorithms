# Different Summands

This algorithm implements a solution to the following problem: Represent a given positive integer 𝑛 as a sum of as many pairwise
distinct positive integers as possible. That is, find the maximum 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be written as
𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + · · · + 𝑎𝑘 where 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑘 are positive integers and 𝑎𝑖 ̸= 𝑎𝑗 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘.
