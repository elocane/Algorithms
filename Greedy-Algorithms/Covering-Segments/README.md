# Covering Line With Segments

This algorithm solves the following problem: Given a set of 𝑛 segments {[𝑎0, 𝑏0], [𝑎1, 𝑏1], . . . , [𝑎𝑛−1, 𝑏𝑛−1]} with integer coordinates on a line, find
the minimum number 𝑚 of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a
set of integers 𝑋 of the minimum size such that for any segment [𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑖] there is a point 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 such
that 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏𝑖.
