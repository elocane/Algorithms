This algorithm solves the following problem. Given two sequences 𝐴 = (𝑎_1, 𝑎_2, . . . , 𝑎_𝑛) and 𝐵 = (𝑏_1, 𝑏_2, . . . , 𝑏_𝑚), find the length of their longest common subsequence, i.e., the largest non-negative integer 𝑝 such that there exist indices 1 ≤ 𝑖_1 < 𝑖_2 < · · · < 𝑖_𝑝 ≤ 𝑛 and 1 ≤ 𝑗_1 < 𝑗_2 < · · · < 𝑗_𝑝 ≤ 𝑚, such that 𝑎_𝑖_1 = 𝑏_𝑗_1, . . . , 𝑎_𝑖_𝑝 = 𝑏_𝑗_𝑝.
